# Healthcare Provider Dashboard – Power BI Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created to analyze healthcare provider performance across billing, treatment cost, insurance, diagnosis, procedure type, and patient demographics. It provides insights to help healthcare administrators, finance teams, and operations departments make informed decisions based on real data from 2024 and 2025.

The dashboard includes filtering capabilities by patient race, year, quarter, and month — enabling granular views across multiple metrics.

## Insights & Recommendations

| Insight Area | Key Findings | Recommendations |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Appointment Trends & Wait Times** | Average wait time exceeded **45 minutes** in 3 out of 5 departments | Implement smarter scheduling and staffing models to reduce delays and improve patient satisfaction. |
| **Billing & Revenue** | Top 10 procedures contributed to **68%** of total revenue | Focus financial planning on high-performing services and streamline claims for quicker reimbursement. |
| **Provider & Department Performance** | Provider efficiency varied by as much as **38%** between top and bottom performers | Use performance dashboards to conduct targeted reviews and provide performance-based support or training. |
| **Procedure Utilization** | Over **22%** of procedures showed low improvement outcomes and were frequently repeated | Review and adjust treatment protocols to reduce unnecessary costs and improve care effectiveness. |
| **Regional Insights** | One facility had **34% higher inflow** but ranked lowest in service outcomes | Evaluate resource allocation, infrastructure, and staff capacity for specific underperforming locations. |
