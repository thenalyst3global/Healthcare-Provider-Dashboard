# Healthcare Provider Dashboard – Power BI Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created to analyze healthcare provider performance across billing, treatment cost, insurance, diagnosis, procedure type, and patient demographics. It provides insights to help healthcare administrators, finance teams, and operations departments make informed decisions based on real data from 2024 and 2025.

The dashboard includes filtering capabilities by patient race, year, quarter, and month — enabling granular views across multiple metrics.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset was provided in **CSV format** and loaded into Power BI. It included the following tables:
- Cities

Data was transformed using **Power Query** and modeled into a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables.

## Insights & Observations

- **Billing increased** from **£1M in 2024** to **£3M in 2025**.
