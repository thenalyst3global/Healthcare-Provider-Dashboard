# Healthcare Provider Dashboard – Power BI Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created to analyze healthcare provider performance across billing, treatment cost, insurance, diagnosis, procedure type, and patient demographics. It provides insights to help healthcare administrators, finance teams, and operations departments make informed decisions based on real data from 2024 and 2025.

The dashboard includes filtering capabilities by patient race, year, quarter, and month — enabling granular views across multiple metrics.
